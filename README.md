# Bayesian Data Analysis
### Data
The dataset is about the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data.

### Approaches fitted:
1. Bayesian Linear regression model fitted with Integrated Nested Laplacian approximations
2. Bayesian linear regression model with auto-regressive random effects on multiple variables.
3. Bayesian linear regression model with both fixed and random effects on combination of variables.

### Evaluation
We performed posterior predictive checks with replicated data on metrics such as Min, Max, Kurtosis, Skewness, and median.
Also, models are compared with AIC, and BIC.
